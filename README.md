_Astrodynamical force models for the JSMD ecosystem._

**DISCAIMER: this package is still in active development!**

This package contains the dominant astrodynamics force models that are used to model satellite trajectories.
The following models are implemented in the package:

### Gravity
- [x] Spherical harmonics: ICGEM
- [x] Spherical harmonics: JPL
- [x] Polyhedron
- [x] Point mass
- [x] Third body
- [ ] Relativistic
- [ ] Mascons
- [ ] PINN

### SRP
- [x] Cannonball
- [x] Flat plate model
- [ ] Ray tracing (TBC)

#### Shadow models
- [ ] Cylindrical
- [ ] Conical
- [ ] Multi plates

### Atmosphere/drag

*TODO*

### Albedo 

*TODO*

### Tides
